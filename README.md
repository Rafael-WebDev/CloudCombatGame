# CloudCombatGame
The evolution of a high school game project that is being redesigned and prototyped in the coding language python.

The code has a mix of two languages, English and French, but most of the variables and functions are written in french for the older versions of the prototypes.

The prototypes or BETA versions will be mostly written in python using mostly the Pygame module (https://www.pygame.org/news). The first version made entirelly by me and two of my friends (names won't be mentioned for privacy reasons) is low key mid. So I will improve it using my extended knowledge (not yet a professional tho) and the use of AI to automate the conversion of some code and help speed up the improvements.

Don't expect a masterpiece but a fun learning experience using the latest technologies like AI to build a better game, close to the original idea, yet different and more fun.

I can do some mistakes, not just linguistically because English ain't my native language, but also on the code it self, so feel free to correct my and the AI's changes on the code.

After the python remaster (and if this project becomes popular), I will remaster the game again in a more proper modern game engine like Unreal or Unity.

(I will try my best to not use copyright content, so some versions can be alterated from the original on my pc, like the images or the sound, because of copy right laws. If I infringe any law, please tell me so I can fix it.)

(Later on, I'm thinking to regroup whit those two friends and maybe more to work in group on this project.)
